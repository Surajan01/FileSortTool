# FileSortTool
A tool to use in the command prompt to quickly loop through image files and sort into different directories.

This tool is designed to allow you to cycle through a main directory full of mixed image files 
It will show you each image as it cycles through 
You will have the opportunity to sort the image into a new file that has already been set up and in named in the program
You select the new location for the file into a specific directory using a letter that is assigned to the directory (this is a time saving feature)

This tool is currently set up to orgainise images of cats and dogs, this can be done as a pre-prosessing step before using the files to train -
- a machine learning model, that can then be used to predict if an image is a cat or a dog.
